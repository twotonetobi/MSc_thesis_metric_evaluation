# Intention-Based Evaluation: Formulas

This document mirrors the formulas and parameter definitions used by the evaluation scripts.
For the original extracted draft, see `assets/evaluation/extracted_formulas_intention_based.md`.

- Self-Similarity (SSM)
- Novelty Function and Boundary Peaks
- RMS ↔ Brightness, Onset ↔ Change correlations
- Beat-to-Peak / Beat-to-Valley alignment
- Variance metrics (Ψ)
- Aggregate notions for structure, rhythm, dynamics

Parameters (defaults):
- L_kernel = 31
- L_smooth = 81
- H = 10
- σ_beat = 0.5
- window_rms = 120
- window_onset = 120
- peak_distance = 15
- peak_prominence = 0.04
- boundary_window = 2.0
